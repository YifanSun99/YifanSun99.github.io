<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a final-year master student at Columbia University from the department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, with a dual master degree at Tsinghua University. I earned my bachelor in Statistics from Fudan University.

Data is the new oil. I am working towards a comprehensive understanding and harnessing of data, driving ML to be more **interpretable**, **reliable**, and **efficient**, particularly in the context of **foundation models**. I am fortunate to work closely with 
  <a href='https://www.yongchanstat.com/'>Prof. Yongchan Kwon</a> and 
  <a href='https://ruoxijia.info/'>Prof. Ruoxi Jia</a>.
