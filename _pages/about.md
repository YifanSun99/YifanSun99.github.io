<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am an incoming Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/). I earned my dual master degree from Tsinghua University and Columbia University, and my bachelor from Fudan University.

I‚Äôve previously worked on **data-centric AI** and **trustworthy AI**, and I‚Äôm always interested in exploring new and exciting machine learning topics.
