<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a master student at Columbia University from the department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, with a dual master degree at Tsinghua University. I earned my bachelor in Statistics from Fudan University.

Data is the new oil. I am working towards a comprehensive understanding and harnessing of data, to thereby design data-efficient algorithms. Besides, I am also striving to make machine learning more reliable and interpretable, particularly in the context of large language model. I am fortunate to work closely with 
  <a href='https://www.yongchanstat.com/'>Prof. Yongchan Kwon</a> and 
  <a href='https://ruoxijia.info/'>Prof. Ruoxi Jia</a>.

My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).
